All init files have an `NN-' numeric prefix.  This allows us to ensure
that certain files (e.g. the ones responsible for loading
`use-package' or setting `message-log-max') get loaded before others,
without having to remember to make every single other file depend on
them.  Ideally I'll eventually figure out a better way of doing this
which would allow the numeric prefix to be dropped.

All init files also have an `as-' prefix after the `NN-'.  This
clarifies that they are opinionated, designed only for my usage, and
typically not instantly reusable.  It also makes it safer to put this
directory on `load-path', which will aid mapping of dependencies
between these files.
