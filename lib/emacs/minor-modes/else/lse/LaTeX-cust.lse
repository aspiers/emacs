;;******************************************************************************
;; These definitions are my personal customisations for the language. This is
;; where you should place YOUR customisations.
;;
;; Sometimes there is a definition(s) in here that override definitions in the
;; main language template file that are here to make that definition more
;; "usable" - this is because I (primarily) try and generate/maintain the main
;; .lse files from EBNF definitions of the language. Sometimes I just can't
;; express the appropriate customisation in the EBNF and so I am forced to
;; override the placeholder definition in this file.
;;
;; This entries in this file should be used as an example of how to create your
;; own customisations. I would caution that you don't delete any definitions
;; though until you are sure that your edit sessions will not be adversely
;; affected. The best way to check out the effects of a delete is to "compile"
;; (else-compile-buffer) the "delete" command for that definition (this will
;; remove it from your edit session and you can nolonger access the definition
;; until next you load language template files) and then see whether anything
;; has been "lost" in your code generation ability i.e. say you think you don't
;; need the definition for placeholder XXX, just place the following lines at
;; the end of one of your source files (when ELSE is enabled for that buffer)
;; and perform a compile (M-x else-compile-buffer) with the cursor positioned at
;; the beginning of the line:
;;
;; DELETE PLACEHOLDER XXX -
;;    /LANGUAGE = "LaTeX" -         
;;
;; This will delete definition XXX from memory.
