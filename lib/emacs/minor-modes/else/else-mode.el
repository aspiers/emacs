;; This routine assumes that it has been called after a regular expression match
;; that indicates a line from the body of a definition has been found
;; ie. \".*\".  The entry for the body form can be of the form " text " with an
;; optional trailer(s) of /TOKEN or /PLACEHOLDER. If the text is meant for
;; substitution i.e. it is not a menu or terminal entry prompt, then we wish to
;; also record indentation information. The algorithm that calculates the number
;; of indents for each line makes an assumption that the first line that is
;; indented establishes a "base" indent level and any subsequent lines have
;; their spacing compared with this count. Therefore, this routine (since it
;; acts on a single line at a time) must take an argument of any current indent
;; level information that may be in force and conversely, provide any indent
;; information that it "discovers" i.e. if there is not indent level currently
;; in force then if the current line contains indent information, that
;; information must be returned to the caller.
;;
;; Further processing is made easier if there are three elements in each 'body'
;; entry, so start the definition off with nil for all three elements and then
;; replace them as needed. The order is /PLACEHOLDER or /TOKEN, indentation and
;; then "any text". It assumes that the match-data from the "body" search string
;; is still valid!
;;
;; 28-Jun-2002: Found a problem when attempting to define bodies that are purely
;; textual in nature and the user doesn't want the indentation rules to be
;; used i.e. definition of a file header with text lines that are heavily
;; indented. Take the (obvious?) approach and use some special character ('@' in
;; this case to denote 'hard' spaces.
