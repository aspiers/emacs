The car of each mapping is a whitespace character, and the cdr is a list of
display vectors (a vector of characters).  The first display vector the
list that can be displayed is used; if no display vector for a mapping can
be displayed, then that character is displayed unmodified.

The characters in are displayed using the `visible-whitespace' face."
