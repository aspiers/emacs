;;;_  . almost a complete re-implementation
;;;_  . msf-abbrev minor mode
;;;_  . more customizable variables
;;;_  . faces and categories for each field type
;;;_  . linked fields
;;  modification of a linked field is replicated to other linked
;;  fields with the same name in the template.
;;  It can be unliked using C-c u, thus becoming just another 
;;  *real* field
;;;_  . multiple field resurrection (even if linked)
;;;_  . added/changed some key bindings and commands
;;;_  . the trim tag used to remove/replace blanks in templates
;;;_  . choose fields can use `completing-read' like functions
;;;_  . improvements to the choose-selection buffer
;;;_  . minor support for blank characters between <choice> tags
;;;_  . a bit of code organization using `allout-mode'
;;;_  . another bit of documentation
;;;_  . custom per major-mode elisp initialization file.
;;  see `msf-abbrev-init-mode'
;;;_  . by using `msf-abbrev-install-locally' you can include
;; abbrevs from other modes without if your file system does not
;; support sym-links.
;;;_  . selecting a region and M-x `msf-cmd-define' inserts the
;; selection to the abbrev file.
;;;_ , Adam Spiers 

;;;_* Commentary
;;
;; This package allows you to place your abbrevs into your filesystem,
;; in a special directory tree. At least that was the original purpose 
;; but recently it has gained some cool features, making from it an
;; alternative templating system for emacs.
;;
;; More information and an impressive demo are available at
;; http://www.bloomington.in.us/~brutt/msf-abbrev.html

;;;_* Usage
;; 
;; Put this file in your load-path and in your .emacs
;;   (require 'msf-abbrev)
;; 
;;   (global-msf-abbrev-mode t) ;; for all modes with abbrevs or
;;   ;; M-x msf-abbrev-mode RET ;; for only one buffer
;;
;;   ;; You may also want to make some bindings:
;;   (global-set-key (kbd "C-c l") 'msf-cmd-goto-root)
;;   (global-set-key (kbd "C-c a") 'msf-cmd-define)
;;
;; While editing in your favorite mode (say ruby =) just make:
;;   M-x msf-cmd-define RET
;; 
;; Enter a name for the new abbrev, eg. "edr" (each_do_render)
;; and in the new created buffer <edr> type:
;;
;;   <field "@collection">.each do |<field link="e" "element">|
;;     <linked "e">.<endpoint>
;;   end
;;   render :<choose link="r">
;;            <choice "nothing">
;;            <choice "inline">
;;            <choice "text">
;;           </choose> => "rendereing using :<linked "r">"
;;
;; Of course this just an example =
;; This is just ruby code, but some text is tagged, this are the
;; modificable fields of this template (not valid sgml format).
;; Save the "edr" buffer and return to your original working
;; buffer, now type the abbreviation name followed with a space to
;; expand the abbreviation:
;;
;;   edr SPC
;;
;; You may as well define a key binding for it's expansion function
;;
;;   (define-key ruby-mode-map 
;;               (kbd "C-c e") 'msf-expand/ruby-mode/edr)
;;   
;; Now the abbreviation is expanded with the template, and you are
;; moved to the first field, so you can navigate between
;; them using TAB or S-TAB, type something while over a linked field,
;; delete one, then recreate it in the same position, press RET
;; over "nothing", when finished either TAB one more time after
;; the last field, or press M-RET over a field to finish with this
;; template, expand another abbrev, experiment a bit and see if 
;; this can help you while coding.
;;
;; There are many key-bindings mapped for each field, to know them
;; place the cursor over a certain field and press: C-h b
;; And take a look after `keymap' Property Bindings.
;; Try doing this while over a chooseable field or a linked field.
;; 
;;
;; Many abbreviation files for popular major-modes are available at 
;; http://www.bloomington.in.us/~brutt/msf-abbrev.html
;; Checkout the documentation and demo in the same page.

;;;_* TODO and Wishlist
;;;_ , A better parser (and syntax) for abbrev files
;;;_ ? Some fields being dependant on a chooseable field's value
;;     (Triggers on fields change, maybe to delete/insert other templates)
;;;_ ! many more users and contributors =)
;;;_ , <region> - replace with region (only makes sense when expansion
;;     bound to a dedicated key, as region won't be relevant when
;;     typing an abbrev
;;;_ , <region-or-query "prompt? "> - as above, but prompt if region
;;     not selected
;;;_ , <include "../other-mode/other-template">
;;;_ , make TAB/S-TAB bindings customisable
;;;_ , make replacing existing abbrevs optional per mode (e.g. cperl-mode)

;;;_* Known Bugs and Not Intended Features
;;   , <elisp "(beginning-of-buffer)"> doesn't work
;;   , <comment "foo"> -> <trim...> mechanism doesn't work - leaves
;;     spurious \n

;;;_* Implementation & Developer Notes
;;;_ , I(vic) re-implemented almost 90% of version 0.98a using 
;; overlays as the *form* containing *fields*, this reduced many
;; searches in the whole buffer.
;; This way the form overlay can serve as a medium for 
;; data interchange between fields and/or functions. 
;;;_ , Also modification hooks are implemented by the function
;; `msf-form-on-modification' that dispatches to other functions.
;; Using overlays allow us to monitor changes only between the form
;; boundaries as anything that happens outside is of no interest
;; to us.
;;;_ , The advice for `yank' became simpler, so I expect pasting
;; large text yanking can be faster.
;;;_ , Resurrection data, cons of (markers . properties) are saved
;; in the form overlay. 
;;;_ , Each field can have a custom modification hook.
