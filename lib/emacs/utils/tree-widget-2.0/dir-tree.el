;;; Commentary:
;;
;; This library is a sophisticated example of usage of the
;; `tree-widget' library.
;;
;; It defines the command `dir-tree' which displays a directory tree.
;; A directory content is read when unfolding the corresponding node
;; and reused later.  To refresh a directory content just click on the
;; corresponding node name.  Also, you can change the select/unselect
;; state of a file entry by clicking on it.
;;
;; To install and use, put this file on your Emacs-Lisp load path and
;; add the following into your ~/.emacs startup file:
;;
;; (require 'dir-tree)
