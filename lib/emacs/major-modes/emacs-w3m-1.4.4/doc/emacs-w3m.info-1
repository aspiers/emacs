Preliminary remarks
*******************

   Emacs/W3 (http://www.cs.indiana.edu/elisp/w3/docs.html) once was the
most popular web browser on Emacs.  However, it worked so slowly that
we wanted a speedy alternative.  On the other hand, w3m
(http://w3m.sourceforge.net/) was a pager with WWW capability,
developed by Akinori ITO.  Although it was a pager, it was possible to
use it as a text-mode WWW browser, so we started developing an Emacs
interface to w3m.

   Our special thanks go to Akinori ITO and the w3m team for the
excellent w3m program.  We would also like to thank everybody who has
submitted comments, suggestions, and bug fixes.  Even though we're not
aware of any problems, all responsibility for this program is ours (the
emacs-w3m development team), but there is absolutely no warranty.  The
emacs-w3m program was first created by TSUCHIYA Masatoshi in June 2000.

   See also the emacs-w3m official page (http://emacs-w3m.namazu.org/).

It's so easy to begin to use emacs-w3m
**************************************

   Emacs-w3m may have already been installed on your system, in which
case you can skip this section and begin to use the program at once.  If
you're not that lucky, read on to learn how to install emacs-w3m.

File: emacs-w3m.info,  Node: Required Emacs Version,  Next: You Need w3m,  Up: Getting Started

What version of Emacs can be used?
==================================

   You can run emacs-w3m in various versions of Emacsen listed below:

`Emacs 21.x'
     No additional packages are required.

`Emacs 22.x'
     No additional packages are required.  If you're using a prerelease
     version of Emacs 22 (such as versions 21.3.50 or 22.0), make sure
     it is newer than March 2004.

`XEmacs 21.x'
     The APEL package and the `gifsicle' program are required (*note
     Other Requirements::).  We recommend using the latest XEmacs 21.4
     which seems stable.

`Emacs 20.x'
     No additional package is required.  Furthermore, you can see
     monochrome bitmap images inline by using the BITMAP-MULE package
     (*note Other Requirements::).

`Emacs 19.34 (including Mule 2.3)'
     The APEL package, the `new custom' package and the `regexp-opt.el'
     module are required.  If you are using Mule 2.3 based on Emacs
     19.34, you can see monochrome bitmap images inline by using the
     BITMAP-MULE package (*note Other Requirements::).

Using w3m: the reason why emacs-w3m is fast
===========================================

   Emacs-w3m uses the external w3m program as a back-end to retrieve web
contents and as an HTML rendering engine; that's how we could create an
accelerated Emacs web browser with asynchronous operation.

   You must install the latest w3m, it is available at:

   `http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/w3m/'


File: emacs-w3m.info,  Node: Other Requirements,  Next: Installing Emacs-w3m,  Prev: You Need w3m,  Up: Getting Started

Things required to run emacs-w3m
================================

   Depending on the version of Emacs, third party packages may be
required.  This section provides resources to help you find and install
them.

`APEL'
     Indispensable to XEmacs, Emacs 19.34 or Mule 2.3.  You should
     install APEL before building emacs-w3m.  APEL is available at:

     `ftp://ftp.m17n.org/pub/mule/apel/apel-10.6.tar.gz'

     Note that you must not use the APEL XEmacs package (which is
     contained in SUMO).  If you have already installed the APEL XEmacs
     package, use the following directives to replace it with APEL
     which is linked above (you can also use the same directives in
     order to newly install APEL):

          % rm -fr /usr/local/lib/xemacs/xemacs-packages/lisp/apel
          % cd apel-10.6
          % make install-package XEMACS=xemacs-21.4.x\
            PACKAGEDIR=/usr/local/lib/xemacs/xemacs-packages

`gifsicle'
     Indispensable to XEmacs.  There is a known bug in all XEmacs 21.x
     series that won't let it display optimized animated gifs correctly
     or may make it crash when some kind of an interlaced gif image is
     displayed.  Emacs-w3m uses the `gifsicle' program to convert gif
     data in order to make it possible to be handled by XEmacs 21.x.
     It is available at:

     `http://www.lcdf.org/gifsicle/'

`ImageMagick'
     If the `convert' program bundled with the ImageMagick package is
     available on your system, emacs-w3m will use it to resize images
     or to convert `favicon' images into a format Emacs can handle.
     Emacs-w3m will work without ImageMagick, but installing it will
     improve your surfing experience.  You can get the ImageMagick
     package from:

     `ftp://ftp.imagemagick.org/pub/ImageMagick/'

     To manipulate `favicon' images, we recommend version 5.4.0-5 and
     later, previous versions may work but we didn't check them
     thoroughly.

`BITMAP-MULE'
     Used to display monochrome bitmap images inline in Emacs 20.x or
     Mule 2.3 based on Emacs 19.34.  It isn't necessary if you aren't
     interested in images.  It is available at:

     `ftp://ftp.jpl.org/pub/elisp/bitmap/'

`new custom'
     Indispensable to Emacs 19.34 (including Mule 2.3).  The `custom'
     library bundled with Emacs 19.34 is too _old_, its API is
     incompatible with the `new custom' bundled with recent Emacsen.
     The `new custom' for Emacs 19.34 is available at:

     `ftp://ftp.dina.kvl.dk/pub/Staff/Per.Abrahamsen/custom/custom-1.9962.tar.gz'

     Note that Mule 2.3 users should slightly modify it by applying the
     following patch:

          ----8<------8<------8<------8<------8<------8<------8<------8<----

`regexp-opt.el'
     Indispensable to Emacs 19.34 (including Mule 2.3).  The
     `regexp-opt.el' file is included in the `attic/' directory of the
     emacs-w3m distribution.  You may simply copy it somewhere (e.g.
     `site-lisp/' directory) and perform byte-compilation as follows:

          # cp -p attic/regexp-opt.el /usr/local/share/emacs/19.34/site-lisp
          # cd /usr/local/share/emacs/19.34/site-lisp
          # emacs -batch -q -no-site-file -f batch-byte-compile regexp-opt.el

`FLIM'
     The FLIM package is required to use the `shimbun' library.  The
     `shimbun' library is a collection of tools for reading web
     newspapers, you can use it with Gnus, Mew, Nana-gnus, T-gnus,
     Wanderlust, etc. *Note Shimbun Library::.

     Note that the FLIM package requires the APEL package even if you
     are using Emacs 20.x, Emacs 21.x or Emacs 22.x.  Therefore, you
     must install both APEL and FLIM if you would like to use the
     `shimbun' library.  The FLIM package is available at:

     `ftp://ftp.m17n.org/pub/mule/flim/flim-1.14/'

`xml.el'
     This file is required to use `shimbun' modules designed for sites
     which provide update information with RSS format.  Because it is
     distributed with Emacs 21 and later, you do not need to install it
     if you use Emacs 21 or later.  Otherwise, you may simply copy it
     somewhere (e.g. the Emacs `site-lisp/' directory) and perform
     byte-compilation as follows:

          # cp -p attic/xml.el /usr/local/share/emacs/20.7/site-lisp
          # cd /usr/local/share/emacs/20.7/site-lisp
          # emacs -batch -q -no-site-file -f batch-byte-compile xml.el

     If you use Emacs 19.34 (including Mule 2.3), additional options are
     required for byte-compilation as follows:

          # emacs -batch -eval '(put (quote char-after) (quote byte-compile) nil)' -f batch-byte-compile xml.el

`Mule-UCS'
     The Mule-UCS Emacs Lisp package makes your Emacs handle the Unicode
     system.  We recommend you install this package so that emacs-w3m
     can display pages written in UTF-8, etc.  It is available at:

     `ftp://ftp.m17n.org/pub/mule/Mule-UCS/Mule-UCS-0.84.tar.gz'

     When Mule-UCS is installed for Emacs-21.2, it is necessary to apply
     this patch
     (http://tsukuba.m17n.org/mule-archive/2002-3/msg00000.html) before
     installation.

     If you are an XEmacs user, the compiled package is here:

     `ftp://ftp.xemacs.org/packages/mule-ucs-1.04-pkg.tar.gz'


File: emacs-w3m.info,  Node: Installing Emacs-w3m,  Next: Non-UNIX-like systems,  Prev: Other Requirements,  Up: Getting Started

Installing emacs-w3m
====================

   See the official page `http://emacs-w3m.namazu.org/' for
instructions on how to get the latest emacs-w3m.  Is everything ready?
Now, let's begin.

   In order to install emacs-w3m on non-UNIX-like systems (or any system
lacking the ability to execute the `configure' script or has no `make'
command), skip this section and go to the next section *Note
Non-UNIX-like systems::.

  1. First, extract a tarball of the emacs-w3m distribution and enter
     the top directory as follows:

          % tar zxf emacs-w3m-1.4.4.tar.gz
          % cd emacs-w3m-1.4.4

     If you've checked out emacs-w3m from CVS, you have to run
     `autoconf' with no argument to generate the `configure' script.

  2. Run the `configure' script.

          % ./configure

     _Important notice to Gnus users_:

     If multiple versions of Gnus are installed on your system (it is
     likely that there are the released version and the development
     version of Gnus), make sure that the `load-path' contains the
     directory where the version you use is installed (check for the
     `gnus.elc' file).  You can ensure that with the `--with-addpath'
     option as follows:

          % ./configure --with-addpath=/usr/local/share/emacs/site-lisp/gnus

     If you've installed APEL, FLIM or something in non-standard
     directories other than the default `load-path', you must specify
     them using the `--with-addpath' option as follows (you may also
     include the Gnus directory in it separated with `:'):

          % ./configure --with-addpath=/opt/share/apel:/opt/share/flim

  3. Just run `make' and `make install'.  See also the next step if you
     are using XEmacs.

          % make
          % make install

     All Lisp and info files will be installed in the appropriate
     directories.  Now, how do you know what files will go where?  To
     know it beforehand, use this:

          % make what-where

     If you are using Emacs 21, 22 or XEmacs, you had better install
     icon image files.  To do this:

          % make install-icons

     or

          % make install-icons30

     The later is for using the slightly larger icon images.

  4. You can also install emacs-w3m as an XEmacs package using `make
     install-package' instead of `make install' as follows:

          % make
          % make install-package

     In this case, you don't have to execute `make install-icons' nor
     `make install-icons30'.

     If you need to specify the package directory, there are two ways
     to do that:

        * Use the `configure' option `--with-packagedir='.  For example:

               % ./configure --with-packagedir=/opt/xemacs/xemacs-packages
               % make what-where
               % make
               % make install-package

        * Use the `PACKAGEDIR' variable.  For example:

               % ./configure
               % make what-where PACKAGEDIR=/opt/xemacs/xemacs-packages
               % make
               % make install-package PACKAGEDIR=/opt/xemacs/xemacs-packages




File: emacs-w3m.info,  Node: Non-UNIX-like systems,  Next: Minimal Settings,  Prev: Installing Emacs-w3m,  Up: Getting Started

Installing on non-UNIX-like systems
===================================

   If you cannot execute the `configure' script on your system, or if
no `make' command is available, cast the following spell:

     % emacs -batch -q -no-site-file -l w3mhack.el NONE -f w3mhack-nonunix-install

   If APEL, FLIM (or any other library) aren't installed in the
ordinary places, the installer will leave them out.  In such a case, it
is necessary to tell those places to the installer as shown below:

     % emacs -batch -q -no-site-file -l w3mhack.el //c/share/apel://c/share/flim -f w3mhack-nonunix-install


File: emacs-w3m.info,  Node: Minimal Settings,  Prev: Non-UNIX-like systems,  Up: Getting Started

Minimal settings to run emacs-w3m
=================================

   This section mentions some fundamental settings for emacs-w3m.  If
you want to fine-tune your installation, you'll find many customizable
variables in *Note Customizable Variables::.

`Autoloads'
     You don't need this if you've installed emacs-w3m as an XEmacs
     package (*note Installing Emacs-w3m::) because the
     `w3m/auto-autoloads.el' takes care of setting up autoloads.

     In all other cases, put the following line in your `~/.emacs' file:

          (require 'w3m-load)

`Startup File'
     We recommend using the `~/.emacs-w3m' file (which is the default
     value of `w3m-init-file') if you need to twiddle some emacs-w3m
     variables.  This file is similar to `~/.emacs', but is read when
     emacs-w3m starts.  Note that some options shouldn't be modified
     there, for example, `w3m-command'.

`Proxy Gateway'
     If you are behind a firewall and access the Internet through a
     proxy gateway, you need to instruct w3m to use it.

     There are several ways to do this, one is to set the `http_proxy'
     environment variable globally in the shell something like:

          setenv http_proxy http://proxy.hogege.com:8000/

     Another way is to customize the `w3m-command-arguments' variable to
     add the options `-o' and
     `http_proxy=http://PROXY_SERVER_NAME:PORT/'.

     This can also be done in your `~/.emacs-w3m' file as shown below:

          (setq w3m-command-arguments
                (nconc w3m-command-arguments
                       '("-o" "http_proxy=http://proxy.hogege.com:8000/")))

     To specify hosts for which the proxy shouldn't be used (Intranet
     sites and the like), set the `no_proxy' (note that it is not
     `no-proxy') environment variable to a comma-separated list of
     hostnames.  Alternatively, you can set the `w3m-no-proxy-domains'
     variable to a list of domain names (not host names) as follows:

          (setq w3m-no-proxy-domains '("local.com" "neighbor.com"))

     See also the documentation of the `w3m-command-arguments-alist'

Go ahead, just try it
---------------------

   You can invoke emacs-w3m using three different commands, listed
below.  Try one of these commands: a web page is displayed in an Emacs
buffer named "*w3m*", meaning that it is an emacs-w3m buffer.  As you
will probably notice, the major mode for an emacs-w3m buffer is
`w3m-mode', there are also minor modes (*note Managing Bookmarks::).

   This section explains the most fundamental usage of these commands,
see *Note Emacs-w3m Functions:: for more information on them.  See also
*Note Customizable Variables:: for variables you can use to customize
emacs-w3m's behavior.

`w3m'
     Start emacs-w3m, displaying the homepage specified in the
     `w3m-home-page' variable.  The default value for `w3m-home-page'
     is "about:".  Set the `w3m-quick-start' variable to `nil' if you
     want to input a target URL every time you start emacs-w3m.

     You can also use this as an Emacs batch command.  Here's an
     example:

          % emacs -f w3m

     To specify a URL, you could also use:

          % emacs -f w3m http://emacs-w3m.namazu.org/

`w3m-find-file'
     Prompt for a local file name in the minibuffer, and display it in
     emacs-w3m.

`w3m-browse-url'
     Prompt for a URL in the minibuffer, and display it in emacs-w3m.
     This command is provided, if anything, in order to start emacs-w3m
     from other application programs.

   Moving in an emacs-w3m buffer won't be painful if you're an Emacs
user already, since many of the standard keys work as intended.  For
instance, `C-n', `C-v' and `C-s' (which are commonly used to move down
one line, one page, or search downwards for a word) are valid keys in
an emacs-w3m buffer.

   To follow a link, use the `RET' key.  You have to move the point to
a link to do this; links are easily recognizable in a buffer because
they are not displayed like ordinary text: they can be underlined, or
have a different color.  The face `w3m-anchor-face' controls how they
are to be displayed (*note Customizable Variables::).

`RET'
     Display the page pointed by the link under point
     (`w3m-view-this-url').

     The exact behavior of this command depends on the properties of
     the link under point, and on whether you give it a prefix argument
     or not.  See *Note Emacs-w3m Functions:: for details.

   As mentioned above, you can be prompted for a URL when you use the
command `M-x w3m', by setting the `w3m-quick-start' variable to `nil'.
In an emacs-w3m buffer, there are also two popular ways to go to new
pages by entering their URLs, see below.

`RET'
     In an emacs-w3m buffer, you can be prompted for a URL in the
     minibuffer and make emacs-w3m display the corresponding page by
     hitting <RET> after moving the point to the URL displayed in the
     `header-line'.  This feature will feel familiar to you if you are
     used to GUI-based web browsers like Mozilla.  Detailed
     explanations about this can be found in *Note Emacs-w3m
     Functions:: (`w3m-view-this-url').

`g'
     Prompt for a URL in the minibuffer and make emacs-w3m display the
     corresponding page (independently of the position of the point) in
     an emacs-w3m buffer.  This binding will be familiar to you if you
     already use Gnus or Mew (`w3m-goto-url').

`G'
     Prompt for a URL in the minibuffer, and display it in a new
     session.  This function works just like `g'(<M-x w3m-goto-url>),
     except that it opens a new session.  When you use emacs-w3m on
     Emacs 21, 22 or XEmacs, opening a new session means displaying the
     page in a new tab.  For more information about tabs, please refer
     to *Note Using Tabs:: (`w3m-goto-url-new-session').

`c'
     Display the URL of the page being displayed in the echo area and
     put it in the `kill-ring' (`w3m-print-current-url').

`u'
     Display the target URL of the link under point in the echo area
     and put it in the `kill-ring' (`w3m-print-this-url').

   If the page you're reading is today's news or someone's diary, it may
have been updated since you loaded it.  You can refresh the page using
the following command.  (This command can also be useful to force a full
redisplay of the page if it looks broken.)

`R'
     Reload the page (`w3m-reload-this-page').

Moving from place to place in a page
------------------------------------

   Being able to use familiar Emacs movement bindings while browsing a
web page probably fascinates you already.  Believe it or not, there is
more!  Since we value your time, we have added keys to move the point,
scroll the page or find links in a very fast way.  When you master
them, you will understand how handy they are.

   The keys are assigned so that scroll commands can be called using
shorter keystrokes than standard Emacs key bindings.  And since places
where you can input text are pretty specific in web pages (*note
Submitting Forms::), most keys have special meanings and aren't
assigned to `self-insert-command' anymore.

`SPC'
     Scroll downwards.  You may be used to this binding if you use the
     `more' or `less' commands, or Emacs's `view-mode'
     (`w3m-scroll-up-or-next-url').

`DEL'
     Scroll upwards.  You may be used to this binding if you use the
     `less' command or Emacs's `view-mode'
     (`w3m-scroll-down-or-previous-url').

`>'
     Scroll to the left.  The scroll step is given by the
     `w3m-horizontal-scroll-columns' variable, default 10
     (`w3m-scroll-left').

`<'
     Scroll to the right.  The scroll step is given by the
     `w3m-horizontal-scroll-columns' variable, default 10
     (`w3m-scroll-right').

`.'
     Shift to the left (a fine level horizontal scrolling).  The shift
     step is given by the `w3m-horizontal-shift-columns' variable,
     default 2 (`w3m-shift-left').

`,'
     Shift to the right (a fine level horizontal scrolling).  The shift
     step is given by the `w3m-horizontal-shift-columns' variable,
     default 2 (`w3m-shift-right').

`M-l'
     Scroll horizontally so that the current position is centered
     (`w3m-horizontal-recenter').

   The `w3m-mode' major mode defines commands to move to various kinds
of things; namely links, forms, and images (whether they are displayed
or not).

   Let's consider this simple example: suppose we want to search for a
word on the widely-known Google search engine.  Step one: open
`http://www.google.com' in emacs-w3m.  Step two: once the page is
loaded, hit `]'.  Tadaa!  The point has moved to the first form input
in the page, you can now hit `RET' to enter something in it, and then
`C-c C-c' to submit.  Without this command, you would have had to move
into the page using `C-n', `C-f' and so forth, it would have been a
real pain.

<TAB>
     Move the point to the next link (an "anchor" in emacs-w3m lingo).
     More strictly speaking, move the point forwards to the nearest
     anchor.

`M-<TAB>'
`S-<TAB>'
     Move the point to the previous anchor.  More strictly speaking,
     move the point backwards to the nearest anchor
     (`w3m-previous-anchor').

`]'
     Move the point to the next form.  More strictly speaking, move the
     point forwards to the nearest form (`w3m-next-form').

`['
     Move the point to the previous form.  More strictly speaking, move
     the point backwards to the nearest form (`w3m-previous-form').

`}'
     Move the point to the next image.  More strictly speaking, move the
     point forwards to the nearest image (`w3m-next-image').

`{'
     Move the point to the previous image.  More strictly speaking,
     move the point backwards to the nearest image
     (`w3m-previous-image').

Moving from page to page
------------------------

   This section explains how to move from page to page, but not by
following links or inputing URLs (these ways of moving are explained in
*Note Launching and Jumping::).

   This includes commands to move backwards and forwards in history (the
familiar "Back" and "Forward" from other browsers), and the obligatory
"Go to the home page" feature.  You will probably understand this
better after reading the *Note Tracing History:: section.

`B'
     Move back one page in history (`w3m-view-previous-page').  With a
     numeric argument ARG, move back ARG pages.  This is the preferred
     way to go back in time.

`N'
     Move forward one page in history (`w3m-view-next-page').  Of
     course, this will work only if you've used `B' to move back in
     history.  If called with a numeric argument ARG, move forward ARG
     pages.  This command actually allows you to go back to the future!

`H'
     Move to the home page (`w3m-gohome').  You can specify the URL of
     the home page by customizing the `w3m-home-page' variable
     ("about:" by default).

   These commands are exclusive features of emacs-w3m, we were able to
obtain patents on them, so you won't find them anywhere else.  That's
why you must learn to use them today!  (Just kidding.)

`^'
     Attempt to move to the parent directory of the page currently
     displayed.  For instance, it will attempt to move to "http://foo/"
     when "http://foo/bar/" is displayed.  This function has been
     implemented because of the following observation: users of web
     browsers often have to move up one level of directories because
     the information they're looking for isn't displayed on the current
     page (either because it has been deleted, or because a search
     engine took them to the wrong page).

     When you use another web browser, you usually need to remove the
     last component from the URL by using the <DEL> key, etc. several
     times manually.  In emacs-w3m, this operation can be performed in
     only one keystroke, by typing `^'!

<SPC>
     When the current point is located at the end of the buffer and you
     cannot scroll down further, hit the <SPC> key to go on to the "next
     page" (`w3m-scroll-up-or-next-url').  Here, "next page" means the
     page referred to in the special "next" header of the current page
     (read on).  This feature has nothing to do with the history.

     You probably noticed that some websites split their contents over
     several small pages, partly because it's not comfortable for users
     to wait for huge contents to transfer in one go.  For example,
     search results of search engines often appear like that.  On such
     sites, users often need to follow links manually from one page to
     the next in order the access all the information.

     Hopefully emacs-w3m attempts to enable you to browse a series of
     contents over pages as if you were viewing them as a single page,
     by combining two operations: explicitly following links and
     scrolling.

     That's how it works: these kinds of websites often have fields
     such as "next", "prev" or "previous" in the headers of their web
     pages.  These fields contain information about links between
     divided pages.  Emacs-w3m uses these fields to know what to follow.

     Let's take an example with Google again to explain how the two
     operations (following links and scrolling) are combined.  Open
     `http://www.google.com' and search for a word.  If you search for a
     very common word (e.g. "hamburger"), you will get tons of search
     results.  Google returns the first page of search results, after
     having sorted them using its own algorithm and divided them into
     several pages.  Use <SPC> to scroll through this first page.  Keep
     scrolling until you see the end of the web page in the window.
     Here, a surprise is waiting for you.  If you use a web browser
     other than emacs-w3m and want to see the rest of the search
     results, you would have to click on any of the numbers listed under

          Gooooooogle

          1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8...

     to follow the link.  But with emacs-w3m, you can follow the link
     by just typing <SPC>, just as if you were scrolling!

<DEL>
     When the point is located at the beginning of the buffer and you
     cannot scroll upward, hit the <DEL> to go to the "previous" page
     (`w3m-scroll-down-or-previous-url').  Here, the "previous" page
     means the page which is assigned to the "prev" or "previous" fields
     in the header of the current page.  This function has nothing to
     do with the history, and works like
     <SPC>(w3m-scroll-up-or-next-url).

Surfing using the mouse
-----------------------

   The emacs-w3m developers went to some trouble to ensure that normal
people who aren't Emacs otaku can also use emacs-w3m.  You can perform
most web browsing operations using only the mouse except for entering
text, e.g. URL, forms, etc.  Note that sometimes you might still need to
use modifier keys since the emacs-w3m developers are all Emacs otaku...

   Use `mouse-2' to "follow links" (the first basic of web browsing).
Under Emacs 22.1 and newer, you can also follow links using `mouse-1',
depending of the value of `mouse-1-click-follows-link'.

`mouse-2'
     Follow the link under the mouse pointer
     (`w3m-mouse-view-this-url').

`S-mouse-2'
     Follow the link under the mouse pointer in a new session
     (`w3m-mouse-view-this-url-new-session').

   Scrollbar, menubar and toolbar are helpful in emacs-w3m when you use
a mouse (your Emacs must support them, and you must have enabled them).
You can scroll an emacs-w3m window using the scrollbar.  You can invoke
many emacs-w3m commands described in this manual from the "W3M" menu
which appears in the leftmost menubar next to the "File" menu.  Note:
it's not necessary to use the menubar for most emacs-w3m commands, you
can use the toolbar icons instead.

   To switch between buffers in an emacs-w3m window using "Tabs" (*note
Using Tabs::), click on the topmost line in an emacs-w3m window
directory using `mouse-2' or choose one from the "TAB" menu which
appears next to the "W3M" menu.

Return to an Ordinary Life
--------------------------

   Think back.  You probably didn't start Emacs to browse the web, but
to, say, replace some editor's built-in interpreter with scheme, write
Info documentation or put into print your opinion on software patents...
who knows?  While you were using Emacs, you ran into the need to browse
the web for your work.  But you happened to be able to see the web page
without leaving Emacs at all.  Wow.

   Now the time has come to return to work.  Keep it up or the world
won't change!  Type `q' if you think you might need to browse the web
again.  Type `Q' if you don't have any intention to go back to
emacs-w3m for a while.

`q'
     Close an emacs-w3m window and select the other buffer
     (`w3m-close-window').

`Q'
     Save the "arrived URLs" list to disk (*note Tracing History::),
     save cookies (*note Cookie Variables::) and really quit emacs-w3m
     (`w3m-quit').

Toggle displaying inline images
===============================

   If the Emacs version you're using is capable of displaying images in
buffers, then emacs-w3m can display them in web pages, just like
"graphical" browsers like Mozilla do.  You should make sure your Emacs
is correctly setup for images before trying to use any of the following
commands (*note Required Emacs Version::).

   To toggle displaying of images in the current buffer, use `T'.  It
makes emacs-w3m fetch the images from the server, then display them in
the buffer, at the position they would have in a "graphical" browser.
If you hit the key again, images will disappear from the buffer.

   By default, emacs-w3m won't display images, but you can change its
behavior and choose to always display images, for this you need to
customize the `w3m-default-display-inline-images' variable and change
its value from `nil' to `t'.  *Note Customizable Variables::.

   Emacs-w3m also comes with nifty features that let you zoom an image
in or out, save it to a file, or view it in a external viewer.  See also
*Note Moving in a page:: for instructions on how to move from image to
image in an emacs-w3m buffer.

`T'
     Toggle displaying of inline images in this buffer and buffers
     created from this buffer, later on (`w3m-toggle-inline-images').

`I'
     View the image under point in an external viewer
     (`w3m-view-image').

`M-i'
     Save the image under point to an external file.  The default name
     will be the original name of the image, so most of the time `M-i
     RET' will save the image with the right name (`w3m-save-image').

`M-['
     Zoom out the image under point (`w3m-zoom-out-image').

`M-]'
     Zoom in the image under point (`w3m-zoom-in-image').

Going back through time and space
=================================

   Emacs-w3m has several ways to present you with a list of all the
pages you visited before.  The first way is simply called the "emacs-w3m
history", it is a list of the pages you visited in this session,
presented hierarchically, that is: when you follow a link, the page
you're leaving becomes the "parent" of the page you're going to.  It is
a very nice to keep track of the pages you visited, and remember from
where you came if the history gets too long.

   Here is an example of this feature in action, after a short visit to
the GNU Project's homepage:

         EFF: Homepage

   (In fact, this example is slightly edited to fit in 72 columns; the
URLs won't be cut in the actual emacs-w3m buffer.)

   You can get this kind of history using the `s' key in any emacs-w3m
buffer.

   Please note that this history is buffer-local, i.e. specific to an
emacs-w3m buffer.  But emacs-w3m has a unique feature: when you visit a
new page, the history is copied over to the new buffer, so that you can
still access the pages you visited so far.  This is different from the
way Mozilla and others work; in these browsers the history always starts
from scratch in new buffers.

   Emacs-w3m can do more than just record which pages you visited, it
can also save specific locations in those pages, in case you want to go
back to the exact same place in the page.  Press `C-c C-@', and the
location of the cursor will be stored in history.  In order to go back
to that particular location within the page, press `C-c C-v' in the
emacs-w3m buffer visiting the page.

`s'
     Display the list of visited URLs in this session.

`C-c C-@'
     Record the position of the cursor in the page in history.

`C-c C-v'
     Move to the position which has been marked with `C-c C-@'
     (`w3m-history-store-position') in the currently displayed page.

   The other way to have information about past pages is the "arrived
URLs" list: it is a list of the last 500 URLs you have visited in
emacs-w3m.  The list is ordered by date, the most recent coming first,
and for each page the time of visit is displayed.  Here's an example

   You can get this history by passing a prefix argument to the previous
command, i.e. using `C-u s'.  The number of URLs showed in this page is
customizable, see the `w3m-keep-arrived-urls' variable.  It cannot
exceed 500 by default.  *Note Customizable Variables::.

   Of course, in all cases all the lines showed in the examples are
links, you can go to any of the pages you visited previously just like
if you were visiting a regular page, by following the link.

`s'

`C-u s'
     Display the list of URLs visited in this session.  If called with a
     prefix argument, show the list of arrived URLs instead
     (`w3m-history').

move in the history with simple keybindings, i.e. the "Back" and "Next"
features.

That's a favorite with me!
==========================

   Like all modern browsers, emacs-w3m has advanced features related to
bookmarks: it lets you classify them in categories, edit them and of
course, browse them easily.

* Menu:

* Adding Bookmarks::            Adding a URL to your favorites
* Consulting Bookmarks::        Browse your bookmarks

File: emacs-w3m.info,  Node: Adding Bookmarks,  Next: Consulting Bookmarks,  Up: Managing Bookmarks

Adding a URL to your favorites
------------------------------

   There are several ways to add a URL to your bookmarks.  The first
one is to use the `a' key (or call the `w3m-bookmark-add-current-url'
command) to add the page you're currently browsing: it will prompt you
for a section to where the bookmark should go (completion is available
with the <TAB> key) and will let you edit the title of the bookmark
(the default being the title of the current page).  Complete these two
steps, validating each with `RET', and you will see the message "Added"
in the minibuffer, which means (surprise!) that the page has been added
to your bookmarks.

   Another way to add a bookmark is to use the `M-a' key (or call the
`w3m-bookmark-add-this-url' command): it adds the URL under point (that
means, the URL you would be taken to if you followed the link) to the
bookmarks.  As before, you will have to input the section for this
bookmark and its title, the default being this time the name of the
link itself.

   The third and final way to do this is to use `C-u a', this time you
will be prompted for the URL to add, its section, and the title to use
for it in the bookmarks.

`a'
     Add the current page to the bookmarks, or if called with a prefix
     argument, prompt for a URL and add it
     (`w3m-bookmark-add-current-url').

`M-a'
     Add the URL under point to the bookmarks
     (`w3m-bookmark-add-this-url').

Browse your bookmarks
---------------------

   The easiest way to see the bookmarks is to use the `v' key in an
emacs-w3m buffer; another possibility is to go to the special URL
`about://bookmark/'.  You will see your bookmarks, organized by
section, each line being one bookmark.  You can browse them exactly
like you would browse any other page.

   On the bookmarks page a w3m minor mode is activated, the bookmark
mode.  It adds key bindings to edit the bookmarks.  *Note Editing
Bookmarks::.

`v'
     Visit the bookmarks page (`w3m-bookmark-view').

How to change your bookmarks
----------------------------

   The bookmark minor mode (*note Consulting Bookmarks::) offers several
key bindings related to bookmark edition, most noticeably `C-k' to kill
(i.e. delete) a bookmark, and `E' to edit the bookmark file.

   Bookmarks are kept in an HTML file, so you can edit the file by hand,
but be very careful: if you erase the comments emacs-w3m needs to
recognize section names, things can break easily.  If you know the
basics of HTML, the file should otherwise be quite self-explanatory.

`C-k'
     Kill the bookmark under point (`w3m-bookmark-kill-entry').

`E'
     Visit the bookmarks file (`w3m-bookmark-edit').

`C-_'
     Undo the last changes (`w3m-bookmark-undo').

Everybody likes tabs
====================

   Unlike most other text-based browsers, emacs-w3m has support for
tabbed browsing(1).  What is tabbed browsing, you might ask?  It's very
simple: it is a way to represent all active emacs-w3m buffers in a
single window, by showing a line at the top which shows all the buffers
in a simple and self-explaining way, each buffer being shown as a "tab".
This line stays visible all the time and does not scroll with the rest
of the buffer, so that you can switch to another buffer, or use the
feedback it provides at any moment.

   The easiest way to get the feeling of it is to just try, so go on and
open an emacs-w3m session.  If you didn't change anything to the
configuration, the tabs line is active by default, it is this bright
line at the top with a smaller rectangle that shows the title of the
current page.  Now create another w3m buffer (with `G', for example):
now you have two of these rectangles.  These are tabs.

   The most obvious use of tabs is switching: by clicking with the
`mouse-1' button on a tab, you make the buffer it represents active.
It also works with the `mouse-2' button.  It's a very quick and easy
way to work with several emacs-w3m buffers, you just have to point and
click.  (Yeah yeah, I hear you.  You want to switch using the keyboard.
Don't worry, it's also possible.  It's explained in the next section.
Now keep quiet and read on!)

   Another nifty feature is the feedback it provides.  If you are on a
color terminal or window system, emacs-w3m shows the text in the tab in
different colors to show the status of the page(2).  For example, when
the page is being loaded, the text is in red, and goes back to its
default color (usually black) when the loading is complete.  This way
you can tell with a single glance at the tabs line if the page you're
waiting for has arrived or not.

   Finally, if the web page provides a favicon, it will be shown in the
tab as well(3).  More eye-candy for the emacs-w3m user!

   User options:

`w3m-use-tab'
     Whether to activate tabbed browsing or not.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) It's nobody's fault but Emacs 19 or 20 users cannot use tabs.

   (2) Although XEmacs shows all tabs in the same colors at every
moment, you can easily distinguish the selected tab and others and see
the status of the current page in the modeline.

   (3) Under XEmacs, favicons will currently not be shown in the tabs
line.

Creating, killing and moving across buffers
===========================================

   Sooner or later, you will be addicted to emacs-w3m, and you'll have
to manage all your browsing needs with it.  To help you with this
daunting task, we have imagined many different ways to work with
emacs-w3m buffers.
