<h1>Differences between html-mode and html-helper-mode</h1>

There are several similarities between html-helper-mode and html-mode
This isn't surprising, since my mode was inspired by
html-mode. Here's an (incomplete) list of the differences:<p>

<dl>
  <dt> Insertion philosophy
  <dd> html-mode frequently prompts the user in the minibuffer for
       the data to fill in fields like titles or headers.
       In html-helper-mode, prompting is a user-controlled option.<p>

  <dt> Modifying regions
  <dd> In html-helper-mode, every command will instead
       modify the region if it is called with a prefix argument.<p>

  <dt> Automatic text insertion
  <dd> html-helper-mode can automatically insert skeletons for
       new documents and also maintain timestamps.<p>

  <dt> Minimal syntax support
  <dd> html-helper-mode does its best to tell emacs about the syntax
       of HTML documents.<p>

  <dt> Indentation
  <dd> html-helper-mode indents nested lists<p>

  <dt> Highlighting
  <dd> HTML cookies are coloured nicely with hilit19.<p>

  <dt> Keymap
  <dd> A few obsolete cookies
       have been removed, a few new cookies have been added, and
       the keybindings have been completely rearranged to be compliant with
       emacs standards.<p>

  <dt> Completion
  <dd> HTML cookies can be completed in the buffer with M-TAB.<p>


  <dt> Missing features
  <dd> Some features of html-mode are not included. These include the
       ability to quotify old-style HREFs and automatic naming of anchors<p>
