Planner NEWS --- History of user-visible changes    -*- outline -*-

* Changes in Planner 3.40

** Migration to Muse backend from emacs-wiki is complete.
Planner is now based on Emacs Muse, rather than emacs-wiki.  This will
require a few changes to your Planner configuration.  See the
`Creating Your Planner' section of the Planner manual for an example
Planner and Muse configuration.

Other considerations follow.

*** WikiNames are not colorized by default.
If you want WikiName support, add a "(require 'muse-wiki)" line to
your Planner configuration.

*** List items that that begin with "- " should begin with " - ".

*** The use of `planner-option-customized' is deprecated.
Please change any use of `planner-option-customized' to `setq' in your
configuration.  Most of the options that required this no longer
exist.

*** Planner files must have a .muse extension.
Make sure that you rename your Planner files to have a ".muse"
extension, or they will not be recognized.

*** Publishing may be done by means of the planner-publish.el file.
Add "(require 'planner-publish)" to your Planner configuration to use
it.  This will make available several publishing styles that you can
use with `muse-project-alist'.

The difference between planner-specific publishing styles and the
normal Muse publishing styles is that the former can mark up tasks and
notes specially.
