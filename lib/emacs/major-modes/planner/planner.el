;;
;;;_ + Usage
;;
;; Place planner.el in your load path and add this to your .emacs:
;;
;;    (require 'planner)
;;
;; By default and for backward compatibility, the following operations
;; do not have keybindings, and are only accessible from the Planner
;; menu:
;;
;;    planner-copy-or-move-region
;;    planner-delete-task
;;    planner-task-delegated
;;    planner-task-pending
;;    planner-fix-tasks
;;
;; You may find it easier to install keybindings for those operations by
;; inserting the following in your .emacs file:
;;
;;   ;; Note: This changes some of the default key bindings for planner-mode
;;   (planner-install-extra-task-keybindings)
;;
;; If you want to change `planner-directory' and some other variables,
;; either use Customize or use `planner-option-customized'. For
;; example:
;;
;;    (planner-option-customized 'planner-directory "~/Plans")
;;    (planner-option-customized 'planner-publishing-directory
;;                               "~/public_html/plans")
;;
;; and if you want to modify other emacs-wiki variables:
;;
;;    (add-to-list 'planner-custom-variables
;;                 '(some-emacs-wiki-variable . "some-emacs-wiki-value"))
;;    (planner-option-customized 'planner-custom-variables
;;                               planner-custom-variables)
;;
;; See `emacs-wiki-update-project' and `planner-custom-variables' for more
;; details.
;;
;; You can customize Planner. M-x customize-group RET planner RET
;; or see the Options section.
;;
;;; Note:
;;
;; This package extends emacs-wiki.el to act as a day planner, roughly
;; equivalent to the one used by Franklin-Covey.  If they have patents
;; and trademarks and copyrights to prevent me even thinking in terms
;; of their methodology, then I can't believe they care at all about
;; productivity.
;;
;;;_ + Summary
;;
;; * Make a planning file
;;
;; Open a wiki file within your planning directory.  By default,
;; planner-directory is set to "~/Plans". You may have to use C-x C-f
;; to open the file.
;;
;; A plan file generally describes a long-term plan. For example, you
;; could make a plan file for your ThesisProject or your
;; ContinuousLearning. Planner.el can help you organize related ideas,
;; tasks and resources into a coherent plan.
;;
;; * Break your plan into stages
;;
;; Start the file with your "vision", or the goal you intend to
;; accomplish.  Break this up into parts, and create a Wiki file for
;; each part, with defined milestones which constitute the "goal" for
;; that part.
;;
;; * Write out the tasks for each stage
;;
;; In each sub-plan, list out the tasks necessary to accomplish the
;; milestone.  Write them into the file like this:
;;
;; #A _ 1h Call so and so to make a reservation
;;
;; * Decide on a priority for each task
;;
;; The A is the priority of the task.  The _ means it isn't done yet,
;; and the 1h is a quick estimate on how long it will task.  The time
;; estimates are optional.
;;
;; The priorities break down like this:
;;
;;  A: if you don't do it, your plan will be compromised, and you
;;     will have to either abort, backtrack, or make profuse apologies
;;     to someone
;;
;;  B: if you don't do it, your plan will be delayed
;;
;;  C: the plan won't be complete until it's done, but there's no
;;     pressure to do it now
;;
;; * Schedule the tasks
;;
;; Put your cursor on a line containing a task, and type C-c C-c.
;; This will copy the task to a specific day, which you will be
;; prompted for.  The Emacs Calendar pops up, so you can pick a free
;; day (if you use the Emacs diary and appointment system, the
;; Calendar is even more useful).
;;
;; You will now see your new task, with a link back to your planning
;; page.  Selecting this link will take you back to that task on the
;; planning page, where you will see that the planning page's task now
;; has a link to the particular day you scheduled the task for.
;;
;; The two tasks (the one on the planning page, and the one on the
;; daily task list) are linked.  Changing the status of one (using C-c
;; C-x, or C-c C-s, for example) will change the status of the other.
;; If you forward the task to another day (using C-c C-c on the daily
;; task page), the planning page's link will be updated to refer to
;; the new day.  This is so that you can focus on your daily task list
;; during the day, but see an overview of your plan's progress at any
;; time.
;;
;; * Do the work
;;
;; That's it, as far as what planner.el can do.  As you complete tasks
;; each day, they will disappear from view.  This only happens for
;; today's completed and forwarded tasks.
;;
;; Planning is an art, just as estimating time is an art.  It happens
;; with practice, and by thinking about these things.  The Commentary
;; below provides a few of my own thoughts on the matter, although I
;; will say that this an art I have yet to truly develop.
;;
;; http://sacha.free.net.ph/notebook/emacs/planner/README has John Wiegley's
;; original commentary.
;;
;;;_ + And now back to technical matters
;;
;; In order to refresh and renumber all of your tasks according to their
;; actual order in the buffer, simply save the file or call
;; M-x planner-fix-tasks .
;;
;; Here is a summary of the keystrokes available, including a few I
;; did not mention:
;;
;;   M-x plan  Begin your planning session.  This goes to the last
;;             day for which there is any planning info (or today if
;;             none), allowing you to review, and create/move tasks
;;             from that day.
;;
;;   C-M-p     Raise a task's priority
;;   C-M-n     Lower a task's priority
;;
;;   C-c C-s   Mark the task as in progress or delegated
;;   C-c C-x   Mark the task as finished
;;
;;   C-c C-t   Create a task associated with the current Wiki page
;;             If you are on the opening line of a Note entry, it is
;;             assume that the note itself is the origin of the task.
;;   C-c C-c   Move or copy the current task to another date
;;             If the current task is an original (meaning you are in
;;             the buffer where's defined, hopefully a planning page)
;;             then it will be copied, and the original task will also
;;             now point to the copy.  If the current task is a copy,
;;             it will just be moved to the new day, and the original
;;             tasks link will be updated.
;;
;;   C-c C-n   Jump to today's task page
;;
;; If you call (planner-calendar-insinuate), typing 'n' in the Emacs
;; calendar will jump to today's task page.
;;
;;;_ + Planning and schedules
;;
;; Sometimes you will have appointments during the day to schedule,
;; which "block out" time that might otherwise be spent on tasks.
;; Users are encouraged to use the Emacs Calendar for this, along with
;; Diary Mode (see the Emacs manual)
;;.
;;
;; However, there is a way to do scheduling directly in planner-mode.
;; It requires the external tool "remind" (Debian users type "apt-get
;; install remind".  All others go to
;; http://www.roaringpenguin.com/penguin/open_source_remind.php)
;;
;; Once you have remind installed, you will need two scripts in your
;; local bin directory (/usr/local/bin, $HOME/bin, wherever).  These
;; scripts can be downloaded from my web site:
;;
;;   http://sacha.free.net.ph/notebook/emacs/plan2rem
;;   http://sacha.free.net.ph/notebook/emacs/rem2diary
;;
;; Also, download
;;
;;   http://sacha.free.net.ph/notebook/emacs/remind.el
;;
;; and put it somewhere in your load path. Take a look at remind.el
;; for more details. You will need to edit a few things to get it
;; to work.

;; Lastly, here is another snippet for your .emacs file.  It creates a
;; keybinding in planner-mode, C-c C-w, which jumps you to the
;; Schedule section of that file.

;; (defun planner-goto-schedule ()
;;   (interactive)
;;   (goto-char (point-min))
;;   (unless (re-search-forward "^\\* Schedule\n\n" nil t)
;;     (re-search-forward "^\\* Notes")
;;     (beginning-of-line)
;;     (insert "* Schedule\n\n\n\n")
;;     (forward-line -2)))
;;
;; (eval-after-load "planner"
;;   '(progn
;;      (define-key planner-mode-map [(control ?c) (control ?w)]
;;        'planner-goto-schedule)))

;; The contents of a scheduling section look like this, which is
;; rendered in HTML as a table:
;;
;;   * Schedule
;;
;;    8:00 | Wake up
;;   14:00 | Go to the dentist (2:00)
;;   18:00 | Watch TV
;;
;; The start time is given in 24-hour time, with an optional duration
;; occuring in parentheses at the end of the description hs-show(in
;; HOURS:MINUTES).  And off you go!
;;
;; You can also organize this as
;;
;;   8:00 |  8:30 | Wake up
;;  14:00 | 16:00 | Go to the dentist
;;  18:00 | 21:00 | Watch TV
;;
;;;_ + Example planning file
;;
;; The format of a planning file is given below.  You are responsible
;; for keeping it looking like this.  I intentionally did not make
;; planner.el heavy on the UI side of things, too keep it more
;; free-form and open.  This lets you adapt it to whatever your
;; particular preferences might be.
;;
;;----------------------------------------------------------------------
;; * Tasks
;;
;; #A1 _ An open task, very important!
;; #A2 X A closed task (MyPlan)
;; #A3 o A task that's delayed, or delegated (MyPlan)
;;
;; * Notes
;;
;; .#1 This is note number one
;;
;; Notes on note number one!
;;
;; .#2 This weird ".#2" syntax is used because it's what allout.el
;;     likes for enumerated lists, and it makes using
;;     outline-minor-mode (with allout) very handy.  You can omit the
;;     leading period if you like, though.  It's optional.
