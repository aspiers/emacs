planner-el (3.40-1) unstable; urgency=low

Planner is now based on Emacs Muse, rather than emacs-wiki.  This will
require a few changes to your Planner configuration.  See the
`Creating Your Planner' section of the Planner manual for an example
Planner and Muse configuration.

Other considerations follow.

 - WikiNames are not colorized by default.

   If you want WikiName support, add a "(require 'muse-wiki)" line to
   your Planner configuration.

 - List items that that begin with "- " should begin with " - ".

 - The use of `planner-option-customized' is deprecated.

   Please change any use of `planner-option-customized' to `setq' in
   your configuration.  Most of the options that required this no
   longer exist.

 - Planner files must have a .muse extension.

   Make sure that you rename your Planner files to have a ".muse"
   extension, or they will not be recognized.

 - Publishing may be done by means of the planner-publish.el file.

   Add "(require 'planner-publish)" to your Planner configuration to
   use it.  This will make available several publishing styles that
   you can use with `muse-project-alist'.

   The difference between planner-specific publishing styles and the
   normal Muse publishing styles is that the former can mark up tasks
   and notes specially.
