;;; Commentary:

;; This file provides a single Lisp function:
;; `schedule-completion-time'.  It takes an Emacs time object and a
;; quantity of seconds.  It returns an Emacs time object that
;; represents when the given number of seconds will be completed,
;; assuming that work can only be done during work hours.
;;
;; The available work hours are affected by several factors:
;;
;;   1. If timeclock.el is being used, the amount of time left
;;      in the current workday (timeclock-workday-remaining)
;;   2. The amount of time in each workday (schedule-workday)
;;   3. The definition of a work week (schedule-week)
;;   4. Any holidays defined in the Emacs calendar
;;   5. Any appointments in the Emacs diary
;;
;; Taking all of the "block out" periods into account,
;; `schedule-completion-time' will compute when the given number of
;; seconds will be done, based on your current definitions of time
;; available.
;;
;; As an example, here's a function which, given a list of durations
;; in seconds, will return a list of completion times starting from
;; the current moment:
;;
;;   (defun compute-completion-times (&rest durations)
;;     "Compute completion times for a list of DURATIONS (in seconds)."
;;     (let ((now (current-time)))
;;       (mapcar
;;        (function
;;         (lambda (dura)
;;           (setq now (schedule-completion-time now dura))))
;;        durations)))
;;
;; To call this function:
;;
;;    (compute-completion-times 3600 7200 3600)
