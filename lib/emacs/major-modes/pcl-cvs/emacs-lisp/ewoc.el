;; Ewoc Was Once Cookie
;; But now it's Emacs' Widget for Object Collections

;; As the name implies this derives from the `cookie' package (part
;; of Elib).  The changes are pervasive though mostly superficial:

;; - uses CL (and its `defstruct')
;; - separate from Elib.
;; - uses its own version of a doubly-linked list which allows us
;;   to merge the elib-wrapper and the elib-node structures into ewoc-node
;; - dropping functions not used by PCL-CVS (the only client of ewoc at the
;;   time of writing)
;; - removing unused arguments
;; - renaming:
;;   elib-node	==>  ewoc--node
;;   collection ==>  ewoc
;;   tin 	==>  ewoc--node
;;   cookie 	==>  data or element or elem

;;     Introduction
;;     ============
;;
;; Ewoc is a package that implements a connection between an
;; dll (a doubly linked list) and the contents of a buffer.
;; Possible uses are dired (have all files in a list, and show them),
;; buffer-list, kom-prioritize (in the LysKOM elisp client) and
;; others.  pcl-cvs.el uses ewoc.el.
;;
;; Ewoc can be considered as the `view' part of a model-view-controller.
;;
;; A `element' can be any lisp object.  When you use the ewoc
;; package you specify a pretty-printer, a function that inserts
;; a printable representation of the element in the buffer.  (The
;; pretty-printer should use "insert" and not
;; "insert-before-markers").
;;
;; A `ewoc' consists of a doubly linked list of elements, a
;; header, a footer and a pretty-printer.  It is displayed at a
;; certain point in a certain buffer.  (The buffer and point are
;; fixed when the ewoc is created).  The header and the footer
;; are constant strings.  They appear before and after the elements.
;;
;; Ewoc does not affect the mode of the buffer in any way. It
;; merely makes it easy to connect an underlying data representation
;; to the buffer contents.
;;
;; A `ewoc--node' is an object that contains one element.  There are
;; functions in this package that given an ewoc--node extract the data, or
;; give the next or previous ewoc--node.  (All ewoc--nodes are linked together
;; in a doubly linked list.  The `previous' ewoc--node is the one that appears
;; before the other in the buffer.)  You should not do anything with
;; an ewoc--node except pass it to the functions in this package.
;;
;; An ewoc is a very dynamic thing.  You can easily add or delete elements.
;; You can apply a function to all elements in an ewoc, etc, etc.
;;
;; Remember that an element can be anything.  Your imagination is the
;; limit!  It is even possible to have another ewoc as an
;; element.  In that way some kind of tree hierarchy can be created.
;;
;; Full documentation will, God willing, soon be available in a
;; Texinfo manual.

;; In the mean time `grep '^(.*ewoc-[^-]' emacs-lisp/ewoc.el' can help
;; you find all the exported functions:

;;     Coding conventions
;;     ==================
;;
;; All functions of course start with `ewoc'.  Functions and macros
;; starting with the prefix `ewoc--' are meant for internal use,
;; while those starting with `ewoc-' are exported for public use.
;; There are currently no global or buffer-local variables used.


;;; Code:

(eval-when-compile (require 'cl))	;because of CL compiler macros

;; The doubly linked list is implemented as a circular list
;; with a dummy node first and last. The dummy node is used as
;; "the dll" (or rather is the dll handle passed around).
