pcl-cvs wishlist, sorted by decreasing priority

- implement per-directory caching of *cvs* buffers and their corresponding
  ewocs:
   + add ewoc-dump-to-string which dumps a whole ewoc, omitting
     ewoc--buffer and every ewoc--node-start-marker
   + add ewoc-read-to-buffer, which reads a dumped ewoc into
     a given fresh buffer
   + use the above two to overload cvs-quickdir to search for cached
     ewoc dumps first
- option to toggle unknown fileinfos
- allow diffing between arbitrary versions
- add prefix (bind to L) for toggling recursion
