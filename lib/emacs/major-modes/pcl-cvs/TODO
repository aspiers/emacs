pcl-cvs wishlist, sorted by decreasing priority

- fix handing of MESSAGE and DIRCHANGE
- make = and other diffs switch window (so that we can use 'q' binding)
- bind ^ (or maybe .) go up a directory (u and U are already taken)
- more useful naming convention than *cvs*<2>
- add prefix (bind to L) for toggling recursion
