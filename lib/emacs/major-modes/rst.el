;;;
;;;    Support code for editing reStructuredText with Emacs.  The latest version
;;;    of this file lies in the docutils source code repository.
;;;
;;; Description
;;; ===========
;;;
;;; Basically, this package contains:
;;;
;;; - Functions to automatically adjust and cycle the section underline
;;;   decorations;
;;; - A mode that displays the table of contents and allows you to jump anywhere
;;;   from it;
;;; - Functions to insert and automatically update a TOC in your source
;;;   document;
;;; - A mode which supports font-lock highlighting of reStructuredText
;;;   structures;
;;; - Some other convenience functions.
;;;
;;; See the accompanying document in the docutils documentation about
;;; the contents of this package and how to use it.
;;;

;; **IMPORTANT NOTE TO PACKAGERS**: this package is the result of merging:
;;
;; - restructuredtext.el
;; - rst-mode.el
;; - rst-html.el
;;
;; Those files are now OBSOLETE and have been replaced by this single package
;; file (2005-10-30).
;;
;; Installation instructions
;; -------------------------
;;
;; Add this line to your .emacs file and bind the versatile sectioning commands
;; in text mode, like this::
;;
;;   (require 'rst)
;;   (add-hook 'text-mode-hook 'rst-text-mode-bindings)
;;
;; rst-prefix-map is the prefix map for all the functionality provide by this
;; module.  In addition, other shorter bindings are also provided on the
;; mode-specific-map prefix (i.e C-c).
;;
;;
;;    C-c p a (also C-=): rst-adjust
;;
;;       Updates or rotates the section title around point or promotes/demotes
;;       the decorations within the region (see full details below).
;;
;;       Note that C-= is a good binding, since it allows you to specify a
;;       negative arg easily with C-- C-= (easy to type), as well as ordinary
;;       prefix arg with C-u C-=.
;;
;;    C-c p h: rst-display-decorations-hierarchy
;;
;;       Displays the level decorations that are available in the file.
;;
;;    C-c p t: rst-toc
;;
;;       Displays the hierarchical table-of-contents of the document and allows
;;       you to jump to any section from it.
;;
;;    C-c p i: rst-toc-insert
;;
;;       Inserts a table-of-contents in the document at the column where the
;;       cursor is.
;;
;;    C-c p u: rst-toc-insert-update
;;
;;       Find an existing inserted table-of-contents in the document an
;;       updates it.
;;
;;    C-c p p, C-c p n (C-c C-p, C-c C-n): rst-backward-section,
;;    rst-forward-section
;;
;;       Navigate between section titles.
;;
;;    C-c p l, C-c p r (C-c C-l, C-c C-r): rst-shift-region-left,
;;    rst-shift-region-right
;;
;;       Shift the region left or right by two-char increments, which is perfect
;;       for bulleted lists.
;;
;;
;; Other specialized and more generic functions are also available (see source
;; code).  The most important function provided by this file for section title
;; adjustments is rst-adjust.
;;
;; There are many variables that can be customized, look for defcustom and
;; defvar in this file.
;;
;; If you use the table-of-contents feature, you may want to add a hook to
;; update the TOC automatically everytime you adjust a section title::
;;
;;   (add-hook 'rst-adjust-hook 'rst-toc-insert-update)
;;
;; rst-mode
;; --------
;;
;; There is a special mode that you can setup if you want to have syntax
;; highlighting.  The mode is based on `text-mode' and inherits some things from
;; it.  Particularly `text-mode-hook' is run before `rst-mode-hook'.
;;
;; Add the following lines to your `.emacs' file:
;;
;; (setq auto-mode-alist
;;       (append '(("\\.rst$" . rst-mode)
;;                 ("\\.rest$" . rst-mode)) auto-mode-alist))
;;
;; If you are using `.txt' as a standard extension for reST files as
;; http://docutils.sourceforge.net/FAQ.html#what-s-the-standard-filename-extension-for-a-restructuredtext-file
;; suggests you may use one of the `Local Variables in Files' mechanism Emacs
;; provides to set the major mode automatically. For instance you may use
;;
;; .. -*- mode: rst -*-
;;
;; in the very first line of your file. However, because this is a major
;; security breach you or your administrator may have chosen to switch that
;; feature off. See `Local Variables in Files' in the Emacs documentation for a
;; more complete discussion.
;;
;;
;; TODO list
;; =========
;;
;; Bindings
;; --------
;; - We need to automatically add the rst-text-mode-bindings to rst-mode
;; - We need to find better bindings because C-= does not generate an event on
;;   the Macs.
;;
;; rst-toc-insert features
;; ------------------------
;; - rst-toc-insert: We should parse the contents:: options to figure out how
;;   deep to render the inserted TOC.
;; - On load, detect any existing TOCs and set the properties for links.
;; - TOC insertion should have an option to add empty lines.
;; - TOC insertion should deal with multiple lines
;;
;; - There is a bug on redo after undo of adjust when rst-adjust-hook uses the
;;   automatic toc update. The cursor ends up in the TOC and this is
;;   annoying. Gotta fix that.
;;
;; rst-mode
;; --------
;; - Look at the possibility of converting rst-mode from a Major mode to a Minor
;;   mode of text-mode.
;;
;; Other
;; -----
;; - We should rename "adornment" to "decoration" or vice-versa in this
;;   document.
;; - Add an option to forego using the file structure in order to make
;;   suggestion, and to always use the preferred decorations to do that.

;; Section Decoration Adjusment
;; ============================
;;
;; The following functions implement a smart automatic title sectioning feature.
;; The idea is that with the cursor sitting on a section title, we try to get as
;; much information from context and try to do the best thing automatically.
;; This function can be invoked many times and/or with prefix argument to rotate
;; between the various sectioning decorations.
;;
;; Definitions: the two forms of sectioning define semantically separate section
;; levels.  A sectioning DECORATION consists in:
;;
;;   - a CHARACTER
;;
;;   - a STYLE which can be either of 'simple' or 'over-and-under'.
;;
;;   - an INDENT (meaningful for the over-and-under style only) which determines
;;     how many characters and over-and-under style is hanging outside of the
;;     title at the beginning and ending.
;;
;; Important note: an existing decoration must be formed by at least two
;; characters to be recognized.
;;
;; Here are two examples of decorations (| represents the window border, column
;; 0):
;;
;;                                  |
;; 1. char: '-'   e                 |Some Title
;;    style: simple                 |----------
;;                                  |
;; 2. char: '='                     |==============
;;    style: over-and-under         |  Some Title
;;    indent: 2                     |==============
;;                                  |
;;
;; Some notes:
;;
;; - The underlining character that is used depends on context. The file is
;;   scanned to find other sections and an appropriate character is selected.
;;   If the function is invoked on a section that is complete, the character is
;;   rotated among the existing section decorations.
;;
;;   Note that when rotating the characters, if we come to the end of the
;;   hierarchy of decorations, the variable rst-preferred-decorations is
;;   consulted to propose a new underline decoration, and if continued, we cycle
;;   the decorations all over again.  Set this variable to nil if you want to
;;   limit the underlining character propositions to the existing decorations in
;;   the file.
;;
;; - A prefix argument can be used to alternate the style.
;;
;; - An underline/overline that is not extended to the column at which it should
;;   be hanging is dubbed INCOMPLETE.  For example::
;;
;;      |Some Title
;;      |-------
;;
;; Examples of default invocation:
;;
;;   |Some Title       --->    |Some Title
;;   |                         |----------
;;
;;   |Some Title       --->    |Some Title
;;   |-----                    |----------
;;
;;   |                         |------------
;;   | Some Title      --->    | Some Title
;;   |                         |------------
;;
;; In over-and-under style, when alternating the style, a variable is
;; available to select how much default indent to use (it can be zero).  Note
;; that if the current section decoration already has an indent, we don't
;; adjust it to the default, we rather use the current indent that is already
;; there for adjustment (unless we cycle, in which case we use the indent
;; that has been found previously).

See the documentations of rst-adjust-decoration and

Prefix Arguments
================

The method can take either (but not both) of

a. a (non-negative) prefix argument, which means to toggle the
   decoration style.  Invoke with C-u prefix for example;

b. a negative numerical argument, which generally inverts the
   direction of search in the file or hierarchy.  Invoke with C--
   prefix for example.

"Adjust/rotate the section decoration for the section title around point.

This function is meant to be invoked possibly multiple times, and
can vary its behaviour with a true TOGGLE-STYLE argument, or with
a REVERSE-DIRECTION argument.

General Behaviour
=================

The next action it takes depends on context around the point, and
it is meant to be invoked possibly more than once to rotate among
the various possibilities. Basically, this function deals with:

- adding a decoration if the title does not have one;

- adjusting the length of the underline characters to fit a
  modified title;

- rotating the decoration in the set of already existing
  sectioning decorations used in the file;

- switching between simple and over-and-under styles.

You should normally not have to read all the following, just
invoke the method and it will do the most obvious thing that you
would expect.


Decoration Definitions
======================

The decorations consist in

1. a CHARACTER

2. a STYLE which can be either of 'simple' or 'over-and-under'.

3. an INDENT (meaningful for the over-and-under style only)
   which determines how many characters and over-and-under
   style is hanging outside of the title at the beginning and
   ending.

See source code for mode details.


Detailed Behaviour Description
==============================

Here are the gory details of the algorithm (it seems quite
complicated, but really, it does the most obvious thing in all
the particular cases):

Before applying the decoration change, the cursor is placed on
the closest line that could contain a section title.

Case 1: No Decoration
---------------------

If the current line has no decoration around it,

- search backwards for the last previous decoration, and apply
  the decoration one level lower to the current line.  If there
  is no defined level below this previous decoration, we suggest
  the most appropriate of the rst-preferred-decorations.

  If REVERSE-DIRECTION is true, we simply use the previous
  decoration found directly.

- if there is no decoration found in the given direction, we use
  the first of rst-preferred-decorations.

The prefix argument forces a toggle of the prescribed decoration
style.

Case 2: Incomplete Decoration
-----------------------------

If the current line does have an existing decoration, but the
decoration is incomplete, that is, the underline/overline does
not extend to exactly the end of the title line (it is either too
short or too long), we simply extend the length of the
underlines/overlines to fit exactly the section title.

If the prefix argument is given, we toggle the style of the
decoration as well.

REVERSE-DIRECTION has no effect in this case.

Case 3: Complete Existing Decoration
------------------------------------

If the decoration is complete (i.e. the underline (overline)
length is already adjusted to the end of the title line), we
search/parse the file to establish the hierarchy of all the
decorations (making sure not to include the decoration around
point), and we rotate the current title's decoration from within
that list (by default, going *down* the hierarchy that is present
in the file, i.e. to a lower section level).  This is meant to be
used potentially multiple times, until the desired decoration is
found around the title.

If we hit the boundary of the hierarchy, exactly one choice from
the list of preferred decorations is suggested/chosen, the first
of those decoration that has not been seen in the file yet (and
not including the decoration around point), and the next
invocation rolls over to the other end of the hierarchy (i.e. it
cycles).  This allows you to avoid having to set which character
to use by always using the

If REVERSE-DIRECTION is true, the effect is to change the
direction of rotation in the hierarchy of decorations, thus
instead going *up* the hierarchy.

However, if there is a non-negative prefix argument, we do not
rotate the decoration, but instead simply toggle the style of the
current decoration (this should be the most common way to toggle
the style of an existing complete decoration).


Point Location
==============

The invocation of this function can be carried out anywhere
within the section title line, on an existing underline or
overline, as well as on an empty line following a section title.
This is meant to be as convenient as possible.


Indented Sections
=================

Indented section titles such as ::

   My Title
   --------

are illegal in restructuredtext and thus not recognized by the
parser.  This code will thus not work in a way that would support
indented sections (it would be ambiguous anyway).


Joint Sections
==============

Section titles that are right next to each other may not be
treated well.  More work might be needed to support those, and
special conditions on the completeness of existing decorations
might be required to make it non-ambiguous.

For now we assume that the decorations are disjoint, that is,
there is at least a single line between the titles/decoration
lines.


Suggested Binding
=================

We suggest that you bind this function on C-=.  It is close to
C-- so a negative argument can be easily specified with a flick
of the right hand fingers and the binding is unused in text-mode."

;; Copyright 2003 Stefan Merten <smerten@oekonux.de>
;;
;; Note: this is an update from version 0.2.9 of rst-mode.el
;;
;; DESCRIPTION
;;
;; This package provides support for documents marked up using the
;; reStructuredText format. Support includes font locking as well as some
;; convenience functions for editing. It does this by defining a Emacs major
;; mode.
;;
;; The package is based on text-mode and inherits some things from it.
;; Particularly text-mode-hook is run before rst-mode-hook.
;;
;; OPTIONS
;;
;; There are a number of things which can be customized using the standard
;; Emacs customization features. There are two customization groups for this
;; mode.
;;
;; Customization
;; =============
;;
;; rst
;; ---
;; This group contains some general customizable features.
;;
;; The group is contained in the wp group.
;;
;; rst-faces
;; ---------
;; This group contains all necessary for customizing fonts. The default
;; settings use standard font-lock-*-face's so if you set these to your
;; liking they are probably good in rst-mode also.
;;
;; The group is contained in the faces group as well as in the rst group.
;;
;; rst-faces-defaults
;; ------------------
;; This group contains all necessary for customizing the default fonts used for
;; section title faces.
;;
;; The general idea for section title faces is to have a non-default background
;; but do not change the background. The section level is shown by the
;; lightness of the background color. If you like this general idea of
;; generating faces for section titles but do not like the details this group
;; is the point where you can customize the details. If you do not like the
;; general idea, however, you should customize the faces used in
;; rst-adornment-faces-alist.
;;
;; Note: If you are using a dark background please make sure the variable
;; frame-background-mode is set to the symbol dark. This triggers
;; some default values which are probably right for you.
;;
;; The group is contained in the rst-faces group.
;;
;; All customizable features have a comment explaining their meaning. Refer to
;; the customization of your Emacs (try ``M-x customize``).
