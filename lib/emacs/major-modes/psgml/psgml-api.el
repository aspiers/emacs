;;;; Mapping: map and modify

(defun sgml-map-element-modify (el-fun element)
  "Apply EL-FUN to ELEMENT and the elements in its content.
The EL-FUN may change the buffer.  But if it changes the buffer and
leaves the element with no start-tag some elements may be ignored."
  (let ((level				; level in the element tree
	 0)
	next
	(tick				; change counter
	 (buffer-modified-tick)))
    (while element
      (funcall el-fun element)
      ;; If the function has modified the buffer, a fresh parse is needed
      (when (/= tick (buffer-modified-tick))
	(setq element (sgml-find-element-of (sgml-element-start element)))
	(setq tick (buffer-modified-tick)))
      (cond
       ;; Map content if any
       ((setq next (sgml-element-content element))
	(incf level))
       ;; If in a sub-tree, move to next element
       (t
	(while (and (> level 0)
		    (null (setq next (sgml-element-next element))))
	  (setq element (sgml-element-parent element))

      (setq element next))))

;;;; Map content

(defun sgml-map-content (element element-fun
				 &optional data-fun pi-fun entity-fun)
  "Map content of ELEMENT, calling ELEMENT-FUN for every element.
Also calling DATA-FUN, if non-nil, with data in content."
  (sgml-pop-all-entities)

  (let ((main-buffer-max (point-max)))

       (sgml-set-parse-state element 'start)

           (sgml-parse-data main-buffer-max data-fun pi-fun entity-fun)
           (setq c (sgml-tree-next c))))))))

(defun sgml-parse-data (sgml-goal sgml-data-function sgml-pi-function
				  sgml-entity-function)
  (let ((sgml-throw-on-element-change 'el-done))
    (catch sgml-throw-on-element-change
      (sgml-parse-continue sgml-goal nil t))))


;;;; Entity management

(defun sgml-push-to-string (string)
  "Create an entity from STRING and push it on the top of the entity stack.
After this the current buffer will be a scratch buffer containing the text
of the new entity with point at the first character.
    Use `sgml-pop-entity' to exit from this buffer."
  (sgml-push-to-entity (sgml-make-entity "#STRING" 'text string)))
