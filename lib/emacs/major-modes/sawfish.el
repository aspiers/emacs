;;; sawfish.el --- Sawfish mode.
;; Copyright 1999,2000 by Dave Pearson <davep@davep.org>
;; $Revision$

;; sawfish.el is free software distributed under the terms of the GNU
;; General Public Licence, version 2. For details see the file COPYING.

;;; Commentary:
;;
;; sawfish.el is an emacs mode for writing code for the sawfish window
;; manager <URL:http://sawmill.sourceforge.net/>. As well as providing a
;; programming mode it also allows for direct interaction with the running
;; window manager.

;;; THANKS:
;;
;; John Harper <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk> for help regarding sawfish and rep.
;;
;; Stefan Monnier for finding the font-lock (or lack of) with derived modes
;; problem and providing a fix for GNU Emacs.
;;
;; Jan Vroonhof for his invaluable pointers regarding XEmacs.
;;
;; Hubert Selhofer for the code to syntax highlight "#||#" comments, for the
;; GNU emacs font-lock code to provide support for various rep and sawfish
;; "keywords" and for the GNU emacs emacs-lisp menu removal kludge.

;;; BUGS:
;;
;; o The handling of the apropos buffer totally breaks down under XEmacs.

;;; INSTALLATION:
;;
;; o Drop sawfish.el somwehere into your `load-path'. Try your site-lisp
;;   directory for example (you might also want to byte-compile the file).
;;
;; o Add autoloads for the various sawfish functions to ~/.emacs. At the
;;   very least you want to do something like:
;;
;;   (autoload 'sawfish-mode "sawfish" "sawfish-mode" t)
;;
;; o Add the following to ~/.emacs to ensure that sawfish mode is used when
;;   you go to edit sawfish code:
;;
;;   (setq auto-mode-alist (cons '("\\.sawfishrc$" . sawfish-mode) auto-mode-alist)
;;         auto-mode-alist (cons '("\\.jl$" . sawfish-mode) auto-mode-alist))
