	 This is Monkey -- a nice directory editor for Emacs


This edition of monkey is being distributed (in the hope that people
will find it useful) for three reaons:

	1) as a _fund raiser_ for the projects at regexps.com.  
	   If you obtained this package without paying
	   a download fee to regexps.com, please consider paying 
	   such a fee now by visiting http://www.regexps.com.
	   It will help me to develop additional nice software 
	   and avoid homelessness.

	2) to get a sense of how portable this code is to the 
	   various Emacs environments

	3) to prepare for a major overhaul: I am in the middle of
	   rewriting monkey (to make it more useful as a user
	   interface component in another project).  Before I release
	   the new version, I'd like to see if there is any feedback
	   from users about the current user interface.



Instead of looking at dired listing like this:

  /home/lord/monkey-2:
  total 154
  drwxr-xr-x   2 lord  lord    512 Jul 22 06:04 .
  lrwxr-xr-x   1 lord  lord     34 Jul 22 06:04 .#README -> lord@morrowfield.regexps.com.14798
  drwxr-xr-x  52 lord  lord   6656 Jul 22 05:57 ..
  -rw-rw-r--   1 lord  lord   1739 Jul 22 05:59 fields.el
  -rw-rw-r--   1 lord  lord   8643 Jul 22 05:59 modal.el
  -rw-rw-r--   1 lord  lord  50063 Jul 22 06:04 monkey-dir.el
  -rw-rw-r--   1 lord  lord  50300 Jul 22 05:59 monkey-dir.el.~1~
  -rw-rw-r--   1 lord  lord   3965 Jul 22 05:59 monkey-nenscript.el
  -rw-rw-r--   1 lord  lord  31880 Jul 22 05:59 monkey.el


Monkey gives you outline-style listings like this:

	/^  .
	/^  ..
	@   =NEWS
	    Makefile.in
	/^  PLUGIN
	/^  meta-x
	/>  scheme-library
	/^    scheme-library/.
	/^    scheme-library/..
	      scheme-library/Makefile.in
	/^    scheme-library/PLUGIN
	/^    scheme-library/cgi
	/>    scheme-library/wiki
	/^      scheme-library/wiki/.
	/^      scheme-library/wiki/..
	        scheme-library/wiki/=MAP
	        scheme-library/wiki/=README
	/^      scheme-library/wiki/=bitrot
	        scheme-library/wiki/auth.scm
	        scheme-library/wiki/cgi.scm
	        scheme-library/wiki/config.scm
	        scheme-library/wiki/config.scm.~1~
	        scheme-library/wiki/edit.scm
	        scheme-library/wiki/library.scm
	        scheme-library/wiki/transactions.scm
	        scheme-library/wiki/view.scm
	        scheme-library/wiki/view.scm.~1~
	/^  systas-web
	/^  {arch}


with expandable/contractable subdirectory listings, file hiding
by-regexp, multiple file selection and operation, and file renaming by
regular expression.

A nice directory editor is a small but important thing: I can't
imagine trying to get a lot of work done without monkey anymore --
it's just too handy.


The recommended `.emacs' for monkey is:


(require 'monkey)

;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
;; monkey bindings:
;;
;; These replace the traditional bindings for "find-file" and
;; similar functions.
;;
;; These bindings don't mess up dired which is still available
;; when you want long directory listings.
;;
(global-set-key "\C-X\C-F" 'monkey-file)
(global-set-key "\C-X\C-V" 'monkey-alternate-file)
(global-set-key "\C-X4F" 'monkey-file-other-window)
(global-set-key "\C-x4f" 'monkey-file-other-window)
(global-set-key "\C-x4\C-f" 'monkey-file-other-window)
(global-set-key "\M-g" 'monkey-current-directory)

;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
;; By default, dot files and backup files (ending in ~) will be
;; hidden from view.
;;
(setq monkey-always-hide-regexp "\\(\\....*\\)\\|\\(\\.[^.]\\)\\|\\(.*~\\)")
