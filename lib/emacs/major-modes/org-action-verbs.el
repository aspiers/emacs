;;; Commentary:

;; This is an implementation of an idea I had to keep me honest. In
;; GTD each 'next action' is supposed to be an actual doable thing to
;; further the project it is associated with.

;; When creating next actions or project headlines there is sometimes
;; a tendency to use a heading that is a bit vague/undoable. This is
;; usually a sign that the task the headline represents needs more
;; thinking about and will probably need more than one next action or
;; spawn another project.

;; org-action-verbs was created to use a list of GTD 'action verbs' to
;; diagnose non-functional next action and project headlines. It searches
;; for headlines of a specific TODO type and checks to see if the first
;; word in the headline is specified as an action verb for that TODO
;; type. If not, then it highlights that first non actionable word. 

;; Its a bit like flyspell mode but for checking doable org headlines.

;; To use put the following in your .emacs:
;; (require 'org-action-verbs)

;; To change the default TODO Type->Action Verb table you can set
;; 'org-action-todo-verbs'. Below is an example. The first checks for the
;; right spaceship name associated with the 'SPACESHIP' TODO type, and
;; the right colour for the 'COLOR' and 'COLOUR' TODO types.  

;;(setq org-action-todo-verbs
;;   '(
;;     (("SPACESHIP") . ("Challenger" "Voyager" "Enterprise" "Nostromo" "Apollo" ))
;;     (("COLOUR" "COLOR") . ("Red" "Yellow" "Green" "Aquamarine" "Blue" "Black"))
;;     )
