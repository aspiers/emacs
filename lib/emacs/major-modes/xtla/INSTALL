USING CONFIGURE
===============

1) Select your emacs flavor, this is the option --with-emacs and its default
   is emacs (GNU Emacs).  Choose a location for installing the files, this is
   the option --with-package-dir.

   The default locations are as follows:

   a) GNU Emacs: lisp files goto ${prefix}/share/emacs/site-lisp and
      info files to ${prefix}/info (overridable with --with-lispdir=...
      and --infodir=...)

   b) XEmacs: lisp files goto ${prefix}/lib/xemacs/site-packages/lisp/xtla and info
      files to ${prefix}/lib/xemacs/site-packages/info, (overridable
      with --with-infodir=... and --infodir=...)

   ATTENTION: Files byte-compiled with GNU Emacs are NOT COMPATIBLE with the
   XEmacs and you may experience strange problems during startup when doing
   so.  Thus ensure you are configuring with --with-emacs=xemacs when
   installing XTLA for XEmacs!

   a) GNU Emacs users run:
	./configure

   b) XEmacs users run:
	./configure --with-emacs=xemacs

   It is possible to build xtla in a separate directory. For instance, type

        mkdir emacs_build; cd emacs_build;
          ../configure --with-emacs=emacs

2) Compile the lisp files and info by running:
	make

3) Installing the files

   Run the following command:
	make install-pkg

   a) GNU Emacs: Put the lisp/info path as chosen above into your load-path,
      i.e. add the following to your ~/.emacs.el (if you don't already have an
      equivalent)
        (add-to-list 'load-path (expand-file-name "~/emacs-lisp"))
        (add-to-list 'Info-default-directory-list (expand-file-name "~/info"))

      Now, GNU Emacs knows where to find Xtla, tell it to load it, by adding
   	(require 'xtla-autoloads)
      to your ~/.emacs.el.

      The files xtla-load.el generated in the build directory and in
      the install directory can help you also: Manually, you can run

        M-x load-file RET /path/to/xtla-load.el RET

      (usefull when you want to load Xtla after starting "emacs -q"!),
      or add

        (load-file "/path/to/this/file/in/builddir/xtla-load.el")

      to your ~/.emacs.el


   b) XEmacs: You are lucky nothing to do for you!

   That's it!  Restart Emacs and read the info or start using Xtla by typing
   "C-x T A"

4) Integration with Gnus

   If you use Gnus, you probably want to add

     (tla-insinuate-gnus)

   to your ~/.gnus.el

INSTALLING BY HAND (for GNU Emacs)
==================

Basically you need to copy all the *.el files into a directory that is listed
in your `load-path' and the info file into a directory listed in your
`Info-directory-list'.

Then perform the steps from 3a) in the last section.

NOTES
=====

- XEmacs users will require the file ewoc.el which is also installed in the
  package dir. It's provided in the contrib/ directory of Xtla.
- xtla-browse.el is an add-on package for xtla.el. xtla-browse.el requires
  tree-widget.el 2.0 or higher written by David Ponce.  XEmacs users should
  install the "jde" package.  GNU Emacs in subversions.gnu.org CVS repository
  contains tree-widget.el. If you are using older GNU Emacs or XEmacs, you can
  get it from http://sourceforge.net/projects/emhacks/.  xtla.el doesn't
  require xtla-browse.el. xtla-browse.el is an option.
